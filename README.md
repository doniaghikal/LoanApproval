# LoanApproval
📘 Loan Approval Prediction 

📝 Project Overview

This notebook presents a machine learning pipeline for predicting loan approval outcomes based on applicant data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation. The goal is to build a reliable classifier that can assist financial institutions in automating and improving their loan approval decisions.

📂 Contents

• Data Loading & Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the dataset.
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key patterns in the data.
• Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
• Modeling: Training and evaluating classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
• Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
• Interpretability: Feature importance analysis and insights for decision-making.


🧠 Models Used

• Logistic Regression
• Decision Tree Classifier

📊 Evaluation Strategy

Models are evaluated using:

• Train-test split or cross-validation
• Confusion matrix and classification report
